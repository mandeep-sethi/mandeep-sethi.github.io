        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">HTML CSS JS</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          It may be a bit of a rogue analogy, but I like to think of HTML, CSS
          and JS in terms of a home appliances - in particular, a refrigerator.
          <br />
          <br />
          A fridge / refrigerator has a basic function of keeping the food cold
          so that it lasts longer. In terms of its structure, it’s pretty much a
          square or rectangle with a compressor that provides cooling. This can
          be our <b>HTML</b> part. <br />
          <br />
          Now the design of the structure (fridge) can be enhanced by giving it
          a beautiful paint or some floral vinyl. The interior can also be
          customised with accessories to hold the fresh fruits and veges. This
          part will be handled by <b>CSS</b>. <br /><br />
          The fridge becomes more usable and intuitive when additional features
          like a light bulb that turns on automatically once the fridge door is
          opened and turns back off once it closed. Other cool features would be
          setting a certain temperature for the fresh fruit and veges section,
          adding a beep when the door is left open for more than 30 seconds etc.
          All these interactive functionalities added to the fridge are handled
          by JavaScript.

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">Contorl FLow and Loops</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Our Javascript code by default is executed from top to bottom, line by
          line, however, we can change this with <em>conrtol flow</em>. Control
          flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed
          and when. JavaScript contains conditional statements and
          <em>loops</em> that enables us to control the flow our code, thus,
          making our application more dynamic and interactive. <br /><br />

          Let’s take an example of driving to the supermarket for a grocery run.
          The normal would be get up, take the car/bike, drive to the
          supermarket, buy your grocery and drive back home. What if we add some
          questions to this <br />
          <br />

          1. Check if you have enough supplies for the week <br />
          <br />
          2. If answered yes, do not go to the supermarket, if no, look for the
          grocery list <br />
          <br />
          3. Do you have a list of the groceries you are buying? <br />
          <br />
          4. If yes - lets go to the supermarket <br />
          <br />
          5. If no, let’s make a list. <br /><br />
          6. let’s write the list based on the number of items you wan to add.
          <br /><br />

          You’ll then search your pantry for products to be added in the list
          one at a time in the relevant cabinet drawers - <em>loops</em> All the
          above <em>conditions</em> and <em>loops</em> can change the default
          flow of buying groceries and can result in an organised visit to the
          supermarket

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">What is the DOM</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          In Web development, we have three different languages HTML, CSS and JS
          that work together to make things happen. The DOM( Document Object
          Model) represents the content of an HTML document as a tree structure
          and acts an API or a programming interface which can be used to read
          or update the contents of the document. The most commonly used
          programming language for this JS. The DOM is the real source of truth
          for a website that we see at any given moment. <br />
          <br />
          As an example, I have added a div element to the <em>body</em> of the
          page by first creating it and then appending it. I have also added a
          text to it by using the <em>.innerHTML</em> sub-object. Please see the
          code snipet below: <br />
          <br />
          <q
            >const body = document.body <br />
            const div = document.createElement('div') <br />
            body.append(div) <br />
            div.innerHTML = 'Hello World'</q
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">
          Difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Arrays and Objects are both mutable variables (things that change in
          value when you use them) and are used to store values. Think of an
          _object_ as a car that has a set of characterstics like, make, model,
          engine-size etc. In _objects_, these characteristics are called
          properties which consist of a _key_ and a _value_. <br />
          <br />
          For example, you can declare an object like:
          <q>let car = {make: ‘Ford’, model: ‘Everest’}</q> <br /><br />
          To access the <em>model Key</em> from the <em>car object</em>, we use
          <em>car.model</em> or <em>car[model]</em>. <br /><br />
          An Array on the other side can be used to store a list of multiple
          items where the order is important . <br /><br />
          For example, you can declare an array like:
          <q>let car = [‘Everest’, ‘Fiesta’’]</q> <br /><br />
          To access the car <em>Fiesta</em> from the car array, you can use the
          index (numerical position in the list) of the value we want i.e.
          car[1] as the first value starts from 0 index.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">Functions</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          A function consist of a set of lines or instructions that are
          performed when the function is invoked or called. There are a number
          of advantages of using functions in JavaScript and for this reason
          they are regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks in
          JavaScript. The main advantages are as follows: <br /><br />
          1. Avoids repetition of code i.e. promotes code reusability
          <br /><br />
          2. Makes your program readable <br /><br />
          3. You can divide your problems into smaller chunks of functions
