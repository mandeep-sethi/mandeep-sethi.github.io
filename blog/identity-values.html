          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          After graduating from India, I made an ethical decision of moving to
          New Zealand to progress in my life professionally and personally. That
          was a huge move as I never moved out of house and staying with my
          family is one of the values that I have. If I look at myself 6 years
          back, I’m a completely different person and never regret making that
          move. I have gone so far and I’m constantly pushing myself for more in
          this beautiful place, Aotearoa, that I call home now.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I’m a spiritual person and my culture and religious beliefs have made
          me discover my spirituality as one of the values. From my culture and
          people, I have learned a mix of simplicity and curiosity.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I believe in continuous learning as it can shape your mindset in
          anyway you’d like. I’ve taken other courses and I have definitely
          learned one common pattern from them is that never give up and keep
          praciticing until you feel 100% confident.

          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I find myself struggling if I’m not sure what I’m doing i.e. if the
          course is unstructured or I’m spending too much time on a topic which
          I shouldn’t. After going through some exercises and core material of
          sprint-1, I have found the material well structured and have followed
          the JIT approach which has definitely started to show some results.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I can recall my university project where we were a groupd of four
          working on our final year project. After getting some feedback from
          our mentor about an improvement, we all had some tension as it was
          something that was only agreed upon by two of us. I had to take
          initiative and come up with a mutual idea that had all of us in and
          was accepted by the mentor as well. It was understanding the dislikes
          of everyone and getting everyone to respect others views and opinions
          and taking one step at a time. I’ll be using the same approach of
          respecting everyone’s views so that everyone feels being heard. This
          increases productivity as I have experienced it myself in the past.
          Break down tasks into smaller chunks, assigning it to the team and
          tackle them one by one helps alot to come up with a better solution
          and everyone feels inclusive and a part of the project.
