    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
      core learning?
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Learning about neuroplasticity has given me the confidence to push through hard tasks and to believe in myself
      that my brain is prepared to change and expand, as neuroplasticity explains. Practice is Permanent.
      I’ve learned how a growth mindset enables you to do whatever you want to do and whenever you want to do it.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Lastly, I have also learned that it’s ok to ask for help when in need and it’s ok to not know everything because
      not knowing something means it’s something you can learn, and learning is always a positive thing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      One’s values, ability to empathise and self-awareness play an important role in one’s day-to-day life, for
      instance, self-awareness brings knowledge about yourself, which helps you understand your strengths and
      weaknesses. If you approach programming with self-awareness, it’s highly unlikely that you get stuck with anything
      and know when you seek help. Having empathy and a drive to learn will allow you to recognise when someone else
      needs help, and to help them without judgment.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">What has surprised you the most about core learning?
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Initially, when I started doing the core part, I never thought it would be one of the vital skills that tech
      companies look for in a candidate. Everything in the core part from sprint 1 is there for a reason and I have
      really enjoyed going through all of them, hopefully, this will provide me with an edge when looking for jobs.

    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The most challenging part of the core learning was putting my thoughts into words and then presenting them to
      others in the form of a blog. Also, I found it challenging to spare time for practising meditation because of
      mostly focused on the technical part.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
      core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?

    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      As I mentioned above, I had no idea that a web development Bootcamp would contain core learning as one of the main
      modules of the syllabus. To get into a company or function in the real world and work as a part of wider teams,
      you not only need programming experience but having human skills like self-awareness or empathy will definitely
      help you stand out from the crowd.
    </p>


    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
      Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.

    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Not at all! I think it would have been boring if all it had was programming. If there is nothing different in a
      course, you feel like you are doing the same thing over and over and you start to lose interest. Having a mix of
      both core and tech is a perfect combo.
