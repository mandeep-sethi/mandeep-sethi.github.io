        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Emotional Intelligence, or Emotional Quotient, is defined as one’s
          ability to identify, understand and handle one’s own emotions as well
          as perceive what others are feeling. The term Emotional Intelligence
          was coined by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer, in 1990, and
          the concept has a purpose in helping us navigate the changeable,
          uncertain, complex and ambiguous place we live in.

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">How is it different to IQ?</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Intelligence Quotient of a person is derived from its ability to solve
          problems through a standardised test or a series of tests. Whereas EQ
          is the ability to identify, evaluate and perceive one’s own and
          other’s emotions.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">Why is it important?</h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          From my personal experience, a required IQ level is not the only
          capability a company looks for when hiring a candidate, especially if
          you are applying for leadership positions or higher level jobs. The
          technical side of things do play a vital part in a tech job but
          ability to understand the company’s culture and your team’s mindset
          and emotions is something that would definitely let you excel in your
          career.
