    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Neuroplasticity - meaning our brains are pliable and plastic - refers to
      how the nervous system changes in response to experience because the
      nervous system isn’t set in stone and it's constantly changing. Every
      time we learn something new, we are utilising the power of
      neuroplasticity. When we learn a new skill, recall a memory or think
      about something differently, we begin to make new connections between
      neurons and repeating an activity i.e. practising makes those related
      connections stronger over time, thus easier for our brain to follow that
      pathway. If we keep using this pathway, our brains begin to adapt and
      this new way of thinking, feeling or doing becomes second nature. <br />
      <br />

    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Once you realise that your brain can be re-wired and is malleable, it
      opens up endless opportunities in your life with the fact that anything
      is possible. When learning to code or learning any skill with
      neuroplasticity, we can work on improving our focus, generate meaningful
      connections to the skill we already have, reflect and challenge. This
      will strengthen your neural pathways and neuroplasticity, hence
      maximising your knowledge retainment. \ Another good way to form new
      habits is to tag a new habit onto the end of an existing habit or action
      you already do (if you want to know more about this, check out BJ Fogg’s
      book ‘Tiny Habits’).

    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Individuals with a growth mindset believe their talents or skills can be
      developed through practice, efforts and perseverance. They have a firm
      belief that everything is really possible if you put your mind to it.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      When we commit mistakes, we criticise them as failures and feel upset,
      however, adopting a growth mindset allows you to recognise these
      mistakes as a learning opportunity and the mistake will be a lesson well
      learned. To learn from mistakes, we can have a small retrospection on
      what went wrong and how it can be improved in the future, all while not
      being hard on ourselves for making a mistake. All this is a part of
      learning and growing, where challenges should be treated as
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Having a growth mindset also motivates you to grow professionally as
      well as personally. It helps you keep a healthy relationship with your
      family as you are putting more effort into it, as you would do to learn
      a new skill.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      Something that surprised me in the exploration was the notion that how a
      growth mindset motivates you to put more effort into your learning. Even
      if it’s something that you haven’t tried and it’s way too advanced for
      you, having a growth mindset will tell you to at least give it a go with
      what skills you have and will push you to learn something new that would
      help you take on this challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I will adopt a growth mindset in my learning journey by reminding myself
      that it is okay to not know something, follow the “just-in-case”
      approach, and start using the word “yet” more often and anything can be
      learned, and it is within my capabilities to do so.
