          What is your long-term goal or career pathway?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I have been working in the tech industry for almost 5 years now
          juggling different roles under the hat. I have always wanted to
          contribute to something by actually building it or a part of it, so I
          have decided to follow my passion and pursue a career in software
          development. There are a lot of pros of working in the tech industry
          which I’m living, however, the best part is that you can work from
          anywhere i.e. flexibility, which I love the most.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My strengths are that I’ve an always learning attitude, and a result
          it will keep me motivated on my career pathway of becoming a software
          developer. One of my limitations is that, I sometimes doubt my
          abilities to perform a task. This is something that I have been
          working on by taking up on difficult tasks and giving them a shot.
        </p>

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">
          What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at
          Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I would like to strengthen my learning mindset and would like to boost
          my confidence in my skills and expertise. Also, I would like to
          encourage myself in reaching out to the wider community when
          struggling to find something as that would help me get to the solution
          or path to it efficiently.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          One thing that I do and works best for me is planning the whole week
          in advance and set daily goals. It does take a little bit time of your
          rest day, however, I have found it extremely useful. There will times
          where you couldn’t reach your goal but you’ll definitely find a way to
          do it the next day. Also, using the time box technique with regular
          breaks in between each task really helps you achieve your results
          efficiently.

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          The first place to seach for an issue would be check our Dev Academy
          server as this would save a lot of time trying to google and going
          through different websites. In case, there is nothing in discord, I’ll
          use google for help. After trying my luck on google, say about 30
          minutes, I’ll come back to discord and post my question in the
          relevant channel.

        <h4 class="blog-title topic-text">
          A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          As a student, I would expect my facilitator to be friendly,
          knowledgeable and always there to support me in this journey. I would
          also expect the facilitation team to provide constructive feedback
          through out the course as this helps one understand what they are
          doing good and where’s the room for improvement.

          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things.
        </h4>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I’m fully committed to the course and I have complete support from my
          partner.
