        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        My goal is to gain as much knowledge as possible while at Dev Academy
        and with this hands-on practical learning start working on free lancing
        projects along side with a decent job as a software developer. To be
        able to achieve or atleast reach closest to my goal, I might have to
        start looking for some internship programmes or if I’m lucky, I’m might
        land a junior developer role to start off with my career. I also want to
        make a habit of coding for fun everyday so that it doesn’t become
        something that I only for money and keeps me motivated.

        WWhat do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        An always learning attitude coupled with the ability to stay calm in
        tough or stressful situations will be my biggest strengths. And my
        limitations will be sometimes leaning on trying to learn everything and
        then burning myself out. So the plan is to stick with just-in-time
        approach and not just-in-case.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I believe pair programming might be a challenge as I’m part of the
        online cohort and personally it feels ok to have a conversation in
        person and work on a project, however, pairing up over a zoom/discord
        call isn’t something I have tried. I feel I’ll get use to it once
        started.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I would like to work on my fixed mindset traits and evolve into a growth
        mindset as this will not only help me with the Bootcamp but through out
        my life both personally and professionally.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I expect the Bootcamp team to be knowledgeable and motivated mentors who
        have genuine interest in shaping our career. An approachable and
        friendly mentor is someone that you would expect in your learning
        journey.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I’ll stick to my problem-solving techniques and will go through them
        before reaching out for help. I’ll make sure I have understood a concept
        before moving on to the next one and will ensure I feel confident about
        it. I’ll ask for help from peers and mentors whenever I feel lost or
        have exhausted all other options. This helps in completing the task in a
        timely manner and burning your self out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">My Bootcamp commitments</h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I have my desk setup that includes a second screen + mouse + keyboard
        that should help me speed up my work as I don’t have to switch between
        different tabs, etc and can use two screens separately i.e. watch and
        practice at the same time. I’ll be respectful to my mentors, peers and
        others industry/community representatives and will take an open-mined
        approach when working in pairs and respect other’s ideas.

        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I have been working in the tech industry for almost 5 years now juggling
        different roles under the hat. I have always wanted to contribute to
        something by actually building it or a part of it, so I have decided to
        follow my passion and pursue a career in software development. There are
        a lot of pros of working in the tech industry which I’m living, however,
        the best part is that you can work from anywhere i.e. flexibility, which
        I love the most.

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning:
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        My strengths are that I’ve an always learning attitude, and a result it
        will keep me motivated on my career pathway of becoming a software
        developer. One of my limitations is that, I sometimes doubt my abilities
        to perform a task. This is something that I have been working on by
        taking up on difficult tasks and giving them a shot.

      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at
        Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        I would like to strengthen my learning mindset and would like to boost
        my confidence in my skills and expertise. Also, I would like to
        encourage myself in reaching out to the wider community when struggling
        to find something as that would help me get to the solution or path to
        it efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        One thing that I do and works best for me is planning the whole week in
        advance and set daily goals. It does take a little bit time of your rest
        day, however, I have found it extremely useful. There will times where
        you couldn’t reach your goal but you’ll definitely find a way to do it
        the next day. Also, using the time box technique with regular breaks in
        between each task really helps you achieve your results efficiently.

        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        As a student, I would expect my facilitator to be friendly,
        knowledgeable and always there to support me in this journey. I would
        also expect the facilitation team to provide constructive feedback
        through out the course as this helps one understand what they are doing
        good and where’s the room for improvement.
      </p>

        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are

        I’m fully committed to the course and I have complete support from my
        partner.
