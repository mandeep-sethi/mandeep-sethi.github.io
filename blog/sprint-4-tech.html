    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      I got stuck on the very last part of JS - Gradebook stretch material. As
      it didn’t have any instructions, at first it looked easy but slowly I
      got stuck going down one train of thought. I had to read the tests to
      understand what exactly is happening and what I should expect from the
      function performed. Even after analysing the tests, I couldn’t figure it
      out.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The problem was adding the property “testScores” to the student's object
      without defining the “students” object as a part of the “gradebook”
      object. I started from the basics and tried to understand the concept of
      objects and did some exercises on objects, just to get familiar with the
      “.” and “[]” notations as the problem that I was seeing was with
      accessing and adding properties to an object. However, the task still
      didn’t click with me, so I left it and moved on to the next part in the
      hope of learning some more difficult concepts and then coming back to a
      simpler one with a different approach.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      After, completing the other JS exercises, I came back to it with a fresh
      mind and a new approach and broke down the problem into smaller parts. I
      used “console.log” to print every single output I could on the screen to
      understand where the error was coming from teamed up with some
      pseudocode on my notebook and then slowly progressed towards success,
      yay! It was a frustrating process, to begin with, however, it was a good
      lesson in problem-solving where I used different techniques like
      starting fresh, debugging, writing pseudocode etc.
    </p>
    <h2 class="blog-title topic-text">Solved a Problem Elegantly</h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      By using the problem-solving techniques efficiently and more often after
      the experience I had above when I got stuck, I would say that I was in a
      much better place when solving this new problem.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      This was working on the JS - Built-in Methods exercise where a function
      takes a string and returns it by removing the word “buzz” from it. I
      started this one by writing the pseudocode first which I had to change
      later as the problem that arose wasn’t part of it (as expected), but, it
      really helped. I started by using the “map()” method that would iterate
      through the array (string converted to an array) and then based on the
      condition returns a new array.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      The problem I noticed was that the “map()” was, it replaced the word
      “buzz” with a space “ “ element in the array and when converting it back
      to string (using join()), it added an extra and unnecessary space
      between the words. I used “console.log” a lot and finally figured out
      that part and looked up a new built-in method called “filter()” which
      only adds the element to the new array if meets the condition and
      returns a new array.

      My reflection on the problem-solving techniques
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Pseudocode</span>
      I’m used to taking notes and writing my understanding in a notebook as
      that’s how I feel confident about my learning. I have added this to my
      coding journey as well and write Pseudocode either on a piece of paper
      or type it in the code editor.

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Rubber ducky method</span>
      I do talk to myself and sometimes my partner and take notes when
      debugging. She also has a computer science background so it becomes easy
      for me to explain and expect interesting questions.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Reading error messages</span>
      Sometimes, I find the JS error messages do require some familiarity with
      the concepts before you can understand them. But, they definitely help
      you narrow down the issue once you get your head around them.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Console.logging</span>
      A life-saving technique when it comes to debugging and I use it to
      display every input that goes to the function and output that the
      function returns
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Googling</span>
      I move to google after I have done an extensive search in discord and
      slack channels about the issue I’m facing. And 90% of the time, I get
      the answer from useful websites like stackOverflow and freeCodecamp.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Asking your peers for help</span>
      After I have looked up in discord + google with no luck, I ask a
      question in the relevant channel with all the details including steps
      tried, resources looked up etc.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Asking coaches for help</span>
      I feel confident reaching out to our facilitators about an issue whether
      it be core or tech related as they are very approachable.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-paragraph">
      <span class="inline-heading">Improving your process with reflection</span>
      I didn’t have a reflection as a part of my learning before joining Dev
      Academy. However, I have now made it a vital part to reflect on every
      single topic that I cover. This really helps retain the information in
      your brain and makes you think and relate to the concepts if you have
      had any earlier experience.
